# Show HN: VidClaw — Open-source, self-hosted dashboard for managing AI agents

**URL:** https://github.com/madrzak/vidclaw

**Text:**

I built VidClaw because I kept losing track of my OpenClaw AI agents — which ones were running, what they cost, what skills they had. Terminal-only management doesn't scale past two agents.

VidClaw is a self-hosted dashboard that gives you:

- Kanban board for agent status at a glance
- Usage/cost tracking per agent
- Skills manager (browse, assign, organize)
- Soul editor with syntax highlighting
- Calendar view for cron jobs and heartbeats
- File browser for agent workspaces
- Task queue with automatic execution

It's a static frontend that talks to your local OpenClaw gateway. No extra databases, no Docker complexity. Clone, build, open.

All data stays on your machine — your agents already have access to your life, their dashboard should live there too.

Stack: vanilla JS frontend, Express API, systemd service. Runs on anything from a Pi to a VPS.

Would love feedback on the UI and feature priorities. Happy to answer questions about the architecture.
