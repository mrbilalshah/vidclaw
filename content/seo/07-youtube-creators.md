## Outreach Strategy

1. **Don't cold-pitch.** First, engage with their content — comment on relevant videos, join their Discord.
2. **Offer a demo.** Set up a VidClaw instance they can access (via Tailscale invite) to try hands-on.
3. **Provide a story angle:** "Managing autonomous AI agents from a homelab dashboard" is more interesting than "here's another open-source tool."
4. **Timing:** Reach out after VidClaw hits a milestone (e.g., 100+ GitHub stars, v1.0 release).
5. **Make their job easy:** Provide screenshots, a 2-minute demo video, and bullet points they can use.
