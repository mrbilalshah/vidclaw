## Features Section

### Everything you need to manage autonomous AI agents.
Six panels. One dashboard. Zero cloud dependencies.

#### 🗂️ Kanban Task Board
Organize agent work with drag-and-drop cards: Backlog → Todo → In Progress → Done. Set priorities, assign skills, and let your agent pick up tasks automatically via heartbeat or cron.

#### 📊 Usage & Cost Tracking
Monitor token consumption and cost estimates in real time. Progress bars aligned to Anthropic's rate-limit windows so you never hit a wall blind.

#### 🔄 Hot-Swap Models
Switch between Claude Sonnet, Opus, and Haiku from the navbar. Config hot-reloads — no restart needed.

#### 🧩 Skills Manager
Browse bundled and custom skills. Enable, disable, or author new ones. Your agent loads changes on the next session automatically.

#### 💜 Soul Editor
Shape your agent's persona, identity, and operating instructions with version history and one-click revert. Six starter templates included.

#### 📅 Activity Calendar + 📁 Content Browser
See what your agent worked on each day. Browse workspace files with markdown preview and syntax highlighting.

## Why Self-Host Section

### Why run your own AI agent dashboard?

- **Privacy** — Your prompts, tasks, and agent memory never leave your server.
- **Control** — No vendor lock-in, no surprise pricing changes, no rate-limit middlemen.
- **Transparency** — MIT-licensed. Read every line. Fork it. Make it yours.
- **Security** — Binds to localhost only. Access via Tailscale or SSH tunnel.

---

## How It Works Section

### From install to first task in 3 steps

1. **Install** — One curl command sets up Node.js, Tailscale, and VidClaw.
2. **Open** — Access the dashboard at `localhost:3333` or via your Tailscale network.
3. **Add a task** — Drag a card into "Todo." Your agent picks it up on the next heartbeat.

## Social Proof / Community Section

### Built for people who actually run AI agents.

VidClaw started as a personal tool to manage an OpenClaw agent handling SEO, code tasks, and content writing. Managing an autonomous agent through chat alone was chaotic — VidClaw is the fix.

**Stack:** React · Vite · Tailwind CSS · Express.js · JSON file storage
