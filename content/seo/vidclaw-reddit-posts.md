## General Tips for Posting

- **Don't post all at once** — spread across 2-3 weeks
- **Engage in comments** — reply to every question for the first 24h
- **Lead with value** — the post should be useful even without clicking the link
- **Follow each sub's self-promotion rules** — some require a ratio of non-promo participation
- **Use screenshots/GIFs** — visual posts outperform text-only by 3-5x on these subs
- **Cross-pollinate** — reference discussions from other subs in comments to build momentum
